          <h1>BIOGRAPHY</h1>
          <p>
            Elizabeth II (Elizabeth Alexandra Mary; 21 April 1926 - 8 September
            2022) was Queen of the United Kingdom and other Commonwealth realms
            from 6 February 1952 until her death in 2022. She was queen regnant
            of 32 sovereign states over the course of her lifetime and remained
            the monarch of 15 realms by the time of her death. Her reign of over
            70 years is the longest of any British monarch and the longest
            verified reign of any female head of state in history. Elizabeth was
            born in Mayfair, London, during the reign of her paternal
            grandfather, King George V. She was the first child of the Duke and
            Duchess of York (later King George VI and Queen Elizabeth The Queen
            Mother). Her father acceded to the throne in 1936 upon the
            abdication of his brother Edward VIII, making the ten-year-old
            Princess Elizabeth the heir presumptive. She was educated privately
            at home and began to undertake public duties during the Second World
            War, serving in the Auxiliary Territorial Service. In November 1947,
            she married Philip Mountbatten, a former prince of Greece and
            Denmark, and their marriage lasted 73 years until his death in 2021.
            They had four children: Charles, Anne, Andrew, and Edward. <div class="morecontent">When her
            father died in February 1952, Elizabeth—then 25 years old—became
            queen of seven independent Commonwealth countries: the United
            Kingdom, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, Pakistan, and
            Ceylon (known today as Sri Lanka), as well as head of the
            Commonwealth. Elizabeth reigned as a constitutional monarch through
            major political changes such as the Troubles in Northern Ireland,
            devolution in the United Kingdom, the decolonisation of Africa, and
            the United Kingdom's accession to the European Communities and
            withdrawal from the European Union. The number of her realms varied
            over time as territories gained independence and some realms became
            republics. As queen, Elizabeth was served by more than 170 prime
            ministers across her realms. Her many historic visits and meetings
            included state visits to China in 1986, to Russia in 1994, and to
            the Republic of Ireland in 2011, and meetings with five popes and
            fourteen US presidents. Significant events included Elizabeth's
            coronation in 1953 and the celebrations of her Silver, Golden,
            Diamond, and Platinum jubilees in 1977, 2002, 2012, and 2022,
            respectively. Although she faced occasional republican sentiment and
            media criticism of her family—particularly after the breakdowns of
            her children's marriages, her annus horribilis in 1992, and the
            death in 1997 of her former daughter-in-law Diana—support for the
            monarchy in the United Kingdom remained consistently high throughout
            her lifetime, as did her personal popularity. Elizabeth died aged 96
            at Balmoral Castle in September 2022, and was succeeded by her
            eldest son, Charles III.</div>
